# Predicting-House-Prices-in-Ames-Iowa

Purchasing a home is one of the most important decisions a person can make. By extension, selling a home is also a life-changing decision. Overpaying for a home or undervaluing your home are two critical mistakes that can be financially devastating. No one wants to find out later that they could have asked for a higher price or end up with buyerâ€™s remorse after purchasing a home. Therefore, homebuyers, sellers, and real estate agents need a tool to help them understand how to value a house accurately.

This dataset for this project required extensive cleaning, as nearly one quarter of the variables had missing values. Additionally, most of the variables were categorical variables that required encoding. With limited domain knowledge, I chose an encoding strategy to bin the variables based on the correlation with the target variable. I was ultimately able to build a robust data model that will accurately predict the price of a home based on key features.
